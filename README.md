# ydb - your darts buddy

ydb provides the ability to track darts games vs multiple players across different locations in realtime. it was implemented using meteor.js. It's also possible to practice vs computer players in different difficulty levels to reach a better skill level. ydb also provides detailled stats on your games and the statistical evaluation of your accuracy at darts.

For the accuracy calculation I have used the following papers and reimplemented the explained algorithms.
